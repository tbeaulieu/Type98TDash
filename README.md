# Type98TDash

 QML Dashboard for the Lotus GAWR dashboard.


---

# Installation notes:

1) Obtain the GARW dash installer here: https://github.com/dustinsterk/GARWDashUploader
2) You will need to unzip this dashboard file, rename the folder to "Type98T" (Don't use the quotes), and recompress it. (I know, it's a pain)
3) Upload the dash via the uploader while connected to the GAWR Wifi.
4) Follow the rest of the aforementioned instructions.

There are some prebuilt releases for the uploader, check with the Discord Channel here: https://discord.gg/36kybUTW
